## Fizzbuzz

This is a typical interview question.

Consider the first N natural numbers (say, 1..100)

If the number is divisible by 3, print fizz.
If the number is divisible by 5, print buzz.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz.
Otherwise, print the number itself.

### Variations

#### Intermediate:
Extend the Fizzbuzz algorithm to accept a third number, chug, which will appear on multiples of 7.

#### Advanced:
You receive a list of arbitrary words-to-number combinations.
Dynamically implement a version of Fizzbuzz that works with that list (without knowing its contents).

#### Crazy:
You make a request on the web for a list of numbers and words.
You parse them in the proper format and use multiprocessing to speed up your process.
Use at least 5 subprocesses to analyze the output from 1 to 1000000.
