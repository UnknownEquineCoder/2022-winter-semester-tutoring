# Move to back

In this exercise, we implement a simplified move-to-back algorithm.

In order:
    - Start with an empty string
    - Keep asking the user for a single-letter string (character)
    - If the letter is present in the string, remove it from the string and add it to the end
    - Otherwise, just add it to the end
    - User can stop program execution by entering a certain keyword ('END' for example)

When the user decides to quit the program, display the resulting string

### Advanced
Extend this exercise for arbitrary-length strings
