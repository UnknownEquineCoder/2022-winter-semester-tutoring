# Collatz numbers

### What are collatz numbers?

They are numbers that come from a sort of 'mathematical game'
Start with any number of your choice, then iterate the following steps:

if the number is even, divide it by 2
if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1

Stop whenever you reach 1


#### BONUS POINTS: Is there any number that you can start this game and NEVER end up to 1?
#### Find such numbers if they exist and I'll give you a cookie
